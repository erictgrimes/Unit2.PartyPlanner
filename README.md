# Unit2.PartyPlanner

Welcome to the Party Planner App

The page will be preloaded with parties pulled from fullstacks "events" API. Next to each party is a "delete" button that will remove the party from the page and the API.

On the top of the page is a form to create a new event. All fields are required to ensure consistency.

Use: A place to view all your current events, and add new ones. Then store them to the API.
